The issue can often be resolved by ensuring that all units within the `calc()` function are compatible. For example, using percentages consistently or converting all units to the same unit (like pixels) before calculation.

Here's a possible solution to the width calculation issue:
```css
.element {
  width: calc(50% - 10px); /*Original code may have issues*/
  /*Possible solutions below*/
  /*1. Use only percentages (if possible):*/
  /*width: 49%;*/
  /*2. Use only pixels (if possible):*/
  /*width: calc( (50% / 100) * 800px - 10px );*/
}
```
To fix this, ensure your calculations are clear and all units are compatible.  Additional testing and debugging with different browsers is important to avoid rendering inconsistencies.
